Build
=====

In build directory:

```
cmake ../ava -DAVA_GEN_OPENCL_SPEC=ON -DAVA_MANAGER_LEGACY=ON
make
```

Install OpenCL dependencies such as `opencl-headers`, `clinfo`, OpenCL library (e.g. coming with CUDA).

OpenCL Benchmarking
===================

Clone ava-benchmarks, configure `rodinia/opencl/util/make.mk`:

```
OPENCL_INC = /usr/include
OPENCL_LIB = $(AVA_BUILD_DIR)/install/opencl/lib
LIB_NAME = OpenCL
OCL_LIB = -l$(LIB_NAME)
```

Start AvA manager:

```
./install/bin/legacy_manager install/opencl/bin/worker
```

Build and run any OpenCL benchmark, e.g. in `ava-benchmarks/rodinia/opencl/backprop`:

```
make
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(AVA_BUILD_DIR)/install/opencl/lib ./run
```

Migration Experiments
=====================

Change `DEST_SERVER_IP` in `include/devconf.h` to the migration target server's IP.

Enable cflags `-DAVA_RECORD_REPLAY -DAVA_BENCHMARKING_MIGRATE` in the OpenCL
specification (opencl.c) and rebuild the stack.

Set environment variable `AVA_MIGRATION_CALL_ID=r53` at where the application will run.

> How to know what number should come after `r`?
> This is the total number of the APIs called by a benchmark. It will be printed by
> the guestlib when `AVA_BENCHMARKING_MIGRATE` is enabled. For backprop benchmark,
> the number is 53.

Start AvA manager:

```
./install/bin/legacy_manager install/opencl/bin/worker
```

Start a target API server:

```
./install/opencl/bin/worker migrate 4000
```

`4000` is the port number of the original API server that will serve the application.

Similarly, configure `ava-benchmarks/migration/backprop/util/make.mk`.
Then build and run any migration benchmark under `ava-benchmarks/migration`.
If everything goes well, you will see:
