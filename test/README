AvA test suite
==============

The micro-benchmark is created to understand performance
trade-offs for AvA, and for regression tests of a few
features.

Run `make` to compile both micro-benchmark and regression
tests (libtrivial).

Micro-benchmark
---------------

The micro-benchmark transfers different amounts of data per
call and simulates accelerator computation for different
lengths of time by spinning on the host.

Set the following parameters in `run_microbenchmark_local.sh`:
`WORK=1 SIZE=1024 REPS=10`.

* `WORK`: Simulated API execution time (milliseconds).
* `SIZE`: Transferred data size for an API call (kilobytes).
* `REPS`: The number of repetitions to run during the call.

```
$ ./run_microbenchmark_local.sh
```

Regression test
---------------

Generate API server and guest libraray using
`$AVA_ROOT/cava/samples/libtrivial.nw.c`, and run

```
$ ./trivial_test
```
